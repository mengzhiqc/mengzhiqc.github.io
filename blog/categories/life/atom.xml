    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h1>Greetings</h1>

<p>Happy New Year, My friends. The year of snake have been past, the year of horse come to us. Thanks to you, cause you are the stength of my growing.</p>

<h1>Recall</h1>

<p>To be honest, I have hesitated in the last year. May be, I don&rsquo;t know what i wanna go. My current work is managing our iOS Team. The situation is that I came from a website team and not familiar to technolgy of iOS. In my daily work, I spend more than 80% in our bussiness, like coordinating meeting of different departments. It is not technology it self, I found I were Project Manager more than a iOS tech leader. that makes me awesome and upset. What can i do and what i can be.</p>

<p>Fortunitly, I stopped my steps and considered what i have done, put more attention in technologies should be important, then, I bought some books and spent my time to watch the related totuar documents. Now, I feel good.</p>

<p>Chances are prepared for mans who are ready for it, I don&rsquo;t want to be a loser, so i should put myself in a bowl full of hot water. I need try my best to learn both in tech and the manage.</p>

<h1>Home</h1>

<p>Lay on the bed in home, enjoying the relax. talk with mom and dad, that&rsquo;s great, wishes all of you happiness.</p>

<p>Best Wishes.</p>

<h4>Two Wonderful Days</h4>

<p>Last Satuday, I join a hackthon in IKC with my friends wov. Why I attend this activity? Maybe lacking practice of program makes me feel unset.</p>

This project provide an entrance of Web App. As we all know, web app become more and more popular in china , Almost all componies begin to pay more attentions to it, that&rsquo;s great!</p>

<h4>Division of labor</h4>

<p>I used to write backend services before, so zjh and I were in charge of writing backend program. wov is good at frontend program, that&rsquo;s his job. the backend program&rsquo;s main language is nodejs, A javascript framework base on commonjs. OK, we were programing as this &hellip;</p>

<h4>Episode before end</h4>

<p>There will be half an hour before the end. After merging an code writen by wov, the picture can&rsquo;t present correctly . that&rsquo;s not an good news, we must fix this bug. fortunately, we fix this bug at last.</p>

<h4>Write at the end</h4>

<p>This activity is very meaningful, we met a new friend. we can complete a project in two days. if our passing is existed, the sky will be always blue.</p>
