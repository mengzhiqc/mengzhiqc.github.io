We always make decision everyday, some are correct, and some are wrong. It is strange that when we encount a result that benefit for us, we think it is right , even though lacking evidences. why?

Yestoday i describe a issue that i make wrong decision. If I respect the data from BI department, I will find the trick earlier. so, from now on, according to data, not just deciding with feeling.

Improving our "Data Persuasion", it is import!
