Today is Wednesday, A teamleader of my team come back, he have planed to leave team in 2 weeks, at last he decide to stay here, I'm glad to hear that this morning and he is the first person who turns his heart in my manage career.

I know I am not a developer at the moment, I'm a manager, if my leader give me a work, I can do it well, more than they expect, that's good feel.

Choice between "do things right" and "do right thing", maybe i needn't to choose, they can both exist, doing things right is the base ability of a manager, more than this, we should do right thing and lead the team to the right direction.
