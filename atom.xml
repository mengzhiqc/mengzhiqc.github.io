    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Today is Wednesday, A teamleader of my team come back, he have planed to leave team in 2 weeks, at last he decide to stay here, I&rsquo;m glad to hear that this morning and he is the first person who turns his heart in my manage career.</p>

<p>I know I am not a developer at the moment, I&rsquo;m a manager, if my leader give me a work, I can do it well, more than they expect, that&rsquo;s good feel.</p>

<p>Choice between &ldquo;do things right&rdquo; and &ldquo;do right thing&rdquo;, maybe i needn&rsquo;t to choose, they can both exist, doing things right is the base ability of a manager, more than this, we should do right thing and lead the team to the right direction.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>We always make decision everyday, some are correct, and some are wrong. It is strange that when we encount a result that benefit for us, we think it is right , even though lacking evidences. why?</p>

<p>Yestoday i describe a issue that i make wrong decision. If I respect the data from BI department, I will find the trick earlier. so, from now on, according to data, not just deciding with feeling.</p>

<p>Improving our &ldquo;Data Persuasion&rdquo;, it is import!</p>
