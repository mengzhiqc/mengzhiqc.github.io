<h4>Two Wonderful Days</h4>

<p>Last Satuday, I join a hackthon in IKC with my friends wov. Why I attend this activity? Maybe lacking practice of program makes me feel unset.</p>

<p>We met another friend, a graduate from DongNan Univercity, a very nice boy.  we plan to start a project based on HTML5. This project provide an entrance of Web App. As we all know, web app become more and more popular in china , Almost all componies begin to pay more attentions to it, that&rsquo;s great!</p>

<h4>Division of labor</h4>

<p>I used to write backend services before, so zjh and I were in charge of writing backend program. wov is good at frontend program, that&rsquo;s his job. the backend program&rsquo;s main language is nodejs, A javascript framework base on commonjs. OK, we were programing as this &hellip;</p>

<h4>Episode before end</h4>

<p>There will be half an hour before the end. After merging an code writen by wov, the picture can&rsquo;t present correctly . that&rsquo;s not an good news, we must fix this bug. fortunately, we fix this bug at last.</p>

<h4>Write at the end</h4>

<p>This activity is very meaningful, we met a new friend. we can complete a project in two days. if our passing is existed, the sky will be always blue.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Today is Wednesday, A teamleader of my team come back, he have planed to leave team in 2 weeks, at last he decide to stay here, I&rsquo;m glad to hear that this morning and he is the first person who turns his heart in my manage career.</p>

<p>I know I am not a developer at the moment, I&rsquo;m a manager, if my leader give me a work, I can do it well, more than they expect, that&rsquo;s good feel.</p>

<p>Choice between &ldquo;do things right&rdquo; and &ldquo;do right thing&rdquo;, maybe i needn&rsquo;t to choose, they can both exist, doing things right is the base ability of a manager, more than this, we should do right thing and lead the team to the right direction.</p>
